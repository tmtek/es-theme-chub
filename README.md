# ChubbyBunny EmulationStation Theme
A theme for [Emulationstation](https://emulationstation.org/) and [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/).

The inspiration for the theme comes from a [Destiny](https://www.bungie.net/en/pub/AboutDestiny) clan that I helped found called the [ChubbyBunnySquad](http://chubbybunnysquad.com/). The clan has grown quite large and diverse over the last few years, and I now play all kinds of games with all of these great people regularily. 

I decided to create a custom 4-player Arcade Table-Top and this theme as an homage to the shared experiences we've had together. =)
